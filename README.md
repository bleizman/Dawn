Elevator Pitch 
Waking up in the morning is a confusing experience. After your alarm goes off you are jolted awake by an irritating and repetitive beeping. If you're still half asleep, you may snooze and decide to wake up later. Once you are awake and ready to start the day you go to a number of different apps to see what you missed while you were sleeping. Each news, sports, and weather app takes time to load, preventing you from starting your day. If you want to set a reminder for yourself in the morning, like "Don't forget to bring the report to work!", you have to set a separate reminder in the Reminders app for the time that you wake up. If you decide to snooze, there's no chance that reminder goes off when you're awake and ready for it.

Dawn changes this wake up experience. With a simple user interface and easiliy created alarms, Dawn is the perfect alarm app for both the minimalist and the control freak. You can set an alarm for tomrorow with the click of a button, or create an advanced alarm with custom snooze time, number of snoozes, reminders, repitition, and more. When the alarm goes off, you see how many snoozes are remaining and are given options to snooze or wake up. When you turn the alarm off and are ready to wake up, you're immediately taken to a page showing today's weather, important news stories with links to full articles, and the reminders you set the previous night.

Put your morning back in your hands. Start the day right with Dawn.
